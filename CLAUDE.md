# Development Principles

## Design & Code Standards
- Always refactor design and code to be reusable
- Use shadcn/ui components exclusively for UI development
- Create reusable components when similar UI patterns appear across multiple places
- Extract common functionality into separate components to avoid code duplication

## Communication Rules
- Always respond in Korean
- When user asks to add guidelines/instructions, add them to CLAUDE.md

## Code Quality Rules
- After completing code changes, always run lint and build commands
- Commands: `npm run lint` and `npm run build`

## Work Management Rules
- Always use TodoWrite tool for all tasks before starting work
- Never work without adding tasks to todo list first

## Design Requirements
- All components must be responsive (PC and mobile)
- Use Pretendard font
